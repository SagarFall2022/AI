The field is moving at a remarkable pace. Here are some of the key areas where we're seeing significant progress and emerging trends:\n\n**1. Accelerated Target Identification and Validation:**\n\n*   **Deep Learning for Omics Data:** AI models are becoming incredibly adept at analyzing massive datasets from genomics, proteomics, transcriptomics, and metabolomics. This allows them to identify novel disease targets (genes, proteins, pathways) that were previously hidden or overlooked by traditional methods.\n*   **Network Biology and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs):** Researchers are using GNNs to model complex biological networks. This helps understand how different biological entities interact and can reveal critical nodes or pathways that, when targeted, could have a significant therapeutic effect.\n*   **Integration of Real-World Data (RWD):** AI is being used to analyze RWD from EHRs, insurance claims, and wearable devices. This provides insights into disease progression and treatment responses in real-world populations, helping to validate targets identified in lab settings.\n\n**2. Novel Molecule Design and Optimization:**\n\n*   **Generative AI (GANs, VAEs, Transformers):** These models are revolutionary.

Specific Therapeutic Areas Seeing Major AI Impact:**\n\n*   **Oncology:** Identifying cancer targets, designing targeted therapies, and predicting patient response to immunotherapy.\n*   **Neurology:** Developing treatments for Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and other neurodegenerative diseases by understanding complex brain mechanisms.\n*   **Infectious Diseases:** Rapidly designing antivirals and antibiotics in response to emerging threats.\n*   **Rare Diseases:** Accelerating discovery for conditions with limited patient populations and research.\n\n**Emerging Trends and Innovations:**\n\n*   **\"AI-first\" Biotech Companies:** A new wave of companies is being built from the ground up with AI at their core, focusing solely on AI-driven drug discovery.\n*   **AI-Powered Synthesis:** Integrating AI for molecule design with AI for robotic synthesis, creating closed-loop systems for rapid drug discovery and validation.\n*   **Quantum Computing and AI:** The combination of quantum computing and AI is being explored to tackle even more complex molecular simulations and drug design problems.\n*   **Focus on Protein Degraders (e.g., PROTACs):** AI is playing a role in designing these novel therapeutic modalities that work by degrading target proteins, rather than just inhibiting them.\n\n**Challenges Remain:**\n\nDespite these advancements, challenges persist, including:\n\n*   **Data Quality and Standardization:** The need for high-quality, well-annotated, and standardized biological data.\n*   **Interpretability of AI Models:** Understanding *why* an AI model makes a certain prediction is crucial for scientific validation.\n*   **Clinical Translation:** Successfully translating AI-generated discoveries into approved drugs remains a rigorous and lengthy process.\n*   **Regulatory Scrutiny:** Ensuring AI-driven approaches meet the strict standards of regulatory bodies.\n\nIn summary, AI is no longer just a theoretical concept in drug discovery; it's actively reshaping the entire process, from identifying the initial targets to designing novel molecules and optimizing clinical trials. We're seeing an acceleration in the pace of discovery and a greater likelihood of finding effective treatments for diseases that were previously intractable.\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Tell me more about the second development you found.\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  You're referring to the second key area I mentioned: **Novel Molecule Design and Optimization** using AI. This is a particularly exciting area because AI is moving beyond just analyzing existing data to *creating* new solutions.\n\nLet me elaborate on this:\n\n**The Core Idea: AI as a Molecular Architect**\n\nTraditionally, drug discovery involved chemists painstakingly synthesizing and testing thousands of compounds, a process that is time-consuming, expensive, and often relies on serendipity. AI is changing this paradigm by acting as a sophisticated molecular architect. Instead of randomly trying combinations, AI can be guided by scientific principles and vast datasets to design molecules with specific, desired properties.\n\n**Key AI Technologies Driving This:**\n\n*   **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs):** Imagine two AI networks playing a game. One network (the \"generator\") tries to create realistic molecular structures, while the other network (the \"discriminator\") tries to distinguish between real molecules (from known databases) and the AI-generated ones. Through this adversarial process, the generator gets better and better at creating molecules that are indistinguishable from actual drugs, but potentially novel.\n*   **Variational Autoencoders (VAEs):** VAEs are powerful for learning a compressed \"latent space\" representation of molecules. This latent space captures the essential features of molecular structures. By manipulating points within this latent space, AI can generate new molecular structures that are variations of existing ones or entirely novel.\n*   **Transformer Models (originally from Natural Language Processing):** These models, known for their ability to understand context and relationships in sequential data (like text), are being adapted for molecular design. They can treat molecular structures as \"sentences\" and learn the \"grammar\" of chemistry, allowing them to generate new, valid molecular sequences.\n\n**How AI Designs New Molecules:**\n\n1.  **Defining the Target Profile:** Before AI can design, scientists need to tell it what they're looking for. This includes:\n    *   **Target Binding:** What protein or enzyme does the molecule need to interact with, and how strongly?\n    *   **Pharmacokinetic Properties (ADME):** How will the body Absorb, Distribute, Metabolize, and Excrete the drug? (e.g., does it need to cross the blood-brain barrier? Does it need to be long-lasting in the body?)\n    *   **Pharmacodynamic Properties:** What effect will the drug have on the body?\n    *   **Toxicity and Safety:** What properties should the molecule avoid to minimize side effects?\n    *   **Synthesizability:** Can this molecule actually be made in a lab?\n\n2.  **Training the AI Model:** The AI is trained on massive datasets of known molecules, their properties, and their structures. This teaches the AI the rules of chemistry and the relationships between molecular structure and function.\n\n3.  **Generation and Iteration:** The AI then generates candidate molecules based on the defined target profile. This is often an iterative process:\n    *   The AI proposes a molecule.\n    *   The molecule's properties are predicted using other AI models or simulation tools.\n    *   Based on these predictions, the AI refines its generation strategy and proposes new molecules.\n\n4.  **\"Scaffolding\" and \"Fragment-Based\" Design:** AI can also be used to suggest novel molecular scaffolds (the core structure of a molecule) or to combine known functional fragments in new ways to create a desired molecule.\n\n**Benefits of AI in Molecule Design:**\n\n*   **Speed:** AI can generate millions of potential candidates in a fraction of the time it would take humans.\n*   **Novelty:** AI can explore chemical space beyond human intuition, potentially discovering entirely new classes of drugs.\n*   **Optimization:** AI can simultaneously optimize for multiple desired properties, which is incredibly challenging for human chemists.\n*   **Reduced Costs:** By focusing efforts on more promising candidates early on, AI can reduce the overall cost of drug discovery.\n*   **Access to Undruggable Targets:** AI's ability to explore novel chemical space might unlock treatments for targets that were previously considered \"undruggable\" with traditional methods.\n\n**Real-World Impact:**\n\nMany \"AI-first\" biotech companies are built around these capabilities. They are using these generative AI approaches to design novel drug candidates for a wide range of diseases, and some of these AI-designed molecules are already entering preclinical and even early clinical trials. This represents a significant leap forward in how we discover and develop new medicines.\n\n ### Session: compaction_demo\n\nUser > Who are the main companies involved in that?\ngemini-2.5-flash-lite >  The landscape of companies involved in AI-driven drug discovery, particularly in **novel molecule design and optimization**, is dynamic and includes both established pharmaceutical giants and a rapidly growing number of specialized biotech startups.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the main players, categorized by their approach:\n\n**1.

The presence of that special summary `Event` in your session's history is the tangible result of the compaction process.\n\n**Let's recap what you just witnessed:**\n\n1.  **Silent Operation**: You ran a standard conversation, and from the outside, nothing seemed different.\n2.  **Background Compaction**: Because you configured the `App` with `EventsCompactionConfig`, the ADK `Runner` automatically monitored the conversation length. Once the threshold was met, it triggered the summarization process in the background.\n3.  **Verified Result**: By inspecting the session's events, you found the summary that the LLM generated. This summary now replaces the older, more verbose turns in the agent's active context.\n\n**For all future turns in this conversation, the agent will be given this concise summary instead of the full history.** This saves costs, improves performance, and helps the agent stay focused on what's most important.\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 4.5 More Context Engineering options in ADK\n\n#### 👉 Custom Compaction\nIn this example, we used ADK's default summarizer. For more advanced use cases, you can provide your own by defining a custom `SlidingWindowCompactor` and passing it to the config. This allows you to control the summarization prompt or even use a different, specialized LLM for the task. You can read more about it in the [official documentation](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/context/compaction/).\n\n#### 👉 Context Caching\nADK also provides **Context Caching** to help reduce the token size of the static instructions that are fed to the LLM by caching the request data.
